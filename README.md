# Star_Database_Project
Contributor to the star database project.  
The project required implementation of relational database which in our case consisted of:
1. Information about selected stars such as their mass, name, location, size etc...  
2. Information about galaxies connected to the stars.    
3. Information about scientists involved in the process of observation/discoveries of selected celestial bodies.  
4. Information about research centers connected to the scientists.  
5. Information about observation tools used by the scientists / research centers.
